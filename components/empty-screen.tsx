          Iâ€™m here to assist you in analyzing your Excel spreadsheets. To get
          started, simply upload a spreadsheet file. You can ask me questions
          about specific tables or the entire sheet. I can also handle multiple
          Excel files simultaneously. Once your file is uploaded, you can select
          specific tables to focus your analysis and get detailed insights.
